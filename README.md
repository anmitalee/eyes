# Eye Movement Exercise
## Description
  In this exercise, a duplicate eye is produced based on a given eye and the eyes' pupils will follow the user's mouse movement.
## How to Run
  Download all files to the same folder on your machine, open index.html on browser. Move the mouse across the page to observe the pupils movement
## Future Improvements
  I want to add a mouth to make a face and have the mouth shape changes in response to the positions of the pupils to describe different facial expressions.
